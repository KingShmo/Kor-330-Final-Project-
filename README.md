# Kor-330-Final-Project-
I designed this website to mirror the films themselves. Parasite is about the gap between high and low, so I coded the site to scroll vertically. Snowpiercer is a fight to move forward through a train, so I built it to scroll horizontally. This turns simple navigation into storytelling, forcing the user to move just like the characters.
